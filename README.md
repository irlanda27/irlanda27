# 🍀 Hi, I’m Irlanda!

🙋🏻‍♀️ I’m a front-end developer with a background as a lawyer specialized in Intellectual Property. My passion lies in the intersection between law and technology—two worlds that, now more than ever, shape how we live, work, and connect.

💻 **My stack**: I work mainly with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React**. I also have knowledge of back-end development using **Node.js** and **MongoDB**, which allows me to collaborate on full-stack projects.

💞 I bring to tech the same analytical mindset, attention to detail, and structured thinking that defined my legal career. I love building user-friendly, accessible, and meaningful web applications—especially those that help solve real-world problems.

🌐 With experience in both legal advisory and software development, I’m particularly interested in creating tools that support **digital rights, privacy, innovation, and legal accessibility**.

💭 Known for being organized, resourceful, and collaborative, I enjoy learning new technologies and working on interdisciplinary teams. My ability to translate complex ideas into clear, actionable solutions is one of my strongest assets.

🗣️ **Bilingual**: Spanish (native) and English (fluent); currently improving my French to grow personally and professionally.
